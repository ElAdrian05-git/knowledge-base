# How wireless app installation works on Android

Android devices allow .apk file download and installation system-wide. Any browser that can start the download of a file may be used (default Browser or Chrome work well).

When the file has been downloaded on the device, the installation of the .apk file can be started using:

 * the status bar: tap on the notification saying that the download is ready
 * the Downloads app if available
 * a file browser

After tapping on the .apk file, the device will ask to install the app and provide information on security and feature usage as usual when installing an app.

Updating an app works the same way.
